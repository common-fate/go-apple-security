# go-apple-security

Go bindings for the Apple [Security framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security).

This library covers a subset of the Security framework as required by [Granted](https://granted.dev). This library is not yet used in Granted.

## Acknowledgements

A thankyou to the maintainers of the following repositories for providing a reference implementation on interfacing with the Security framework -- if you're looking to use the MacOS keychain these libraries are worth a look:
